# Robot Manipulator Simulation

## Current Features:
* Object-oriented design
* Revolute joints
* Forward kinematics based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention
* Inverse kinematics with both position and orientation numerically with Newton's method
* Rendered in 2D with Pygame

## Planned Features:
* Prismatic joints
* Simulated dynamics derived symbolically with SymPy and Lagrangian mechanics
* Numerical integration based on Runge-Kutta methods
* Different types of nonlinear control systems, examples: PD+, feedback linearization and adaptive controllers
* Inverse kinematics based on constrained optimization
* 3D rendering
