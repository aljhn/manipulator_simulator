# Robot Manipulator Simulation

## Current Features:
* Revolute joints
* Forward kinematics and jacobian computation based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention
* Inverse kinematics with both position and orientation, computed numerically with Newton's method and the jacobian
* Simulated dynamics derived symbolically with SymPy and Lagrangian mechanics
* Numerical integration based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods
* Trajectory tracking with PD+ and feedback linearization
* Rendered in 2D with Pygame
